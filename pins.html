            <h1>Masque of the Red Death</h1>
              <h3>by Sara Deck for Fright Rags</h3>
          <p>I had to have this pin when I spied on the Fright Rags site a few months ago. Granted, it took me about a second to realize that it was based on Lon Chaney's ode to Edgar Allen Poe, rather than Roger Corman's film, starring Vincent Price, Hazel Court (who I always confuse for Carol Ohmart), and it girl Jane Asher. Even though, not once does Vincent Price look like this in the film, but still..</p>
          <p>I quickly rectified my ignorance by checking out the Youtube clip of Lon is all his opulence.</p>
          <p>The pin is really lovely. It could only be more grand - and terrifingly tacky - if it were bejeweled in red gemstones.</p>
          <p>I find that with pins I am not at all of fan of high delineation, particualrly of faces. Apart from the feathers, which get a little lost due to the size, the lines are effective in the skull - where, in combination with the lighter hue, they make the skull pop. I only wish that the face, hands, and staff head glowed in the dark. But, this is pretty close to perfection.</p>
          <p>It also only has one pin in the back that is not too big, but I wouldn't wear it with a tight knit.</p>
          <p>It is pressing, though I saw nothing to indicate it on the card or pin itself. The back has an elevated Fright Rags logo.</p>

          <h1>Vincent Price "Phosphorescent Pallor"</h1>
          <h3>by Mitch O'Connell for Creepy Co.</h3>
          <p>I gushed when I opened the package and glanced at that beautiful, blue visage. He is even handsomer in person than the site photos had me believe. I thought od blahblah, that wussy, rich pretty boy that he played in Laura. That furrowed brow is not scaring me.</p>
          <p>The hair and edges have the most attention to line but in a way that is not overwhelming. Parts of him also glow in the dark in a soft hue. The face and outer edges of his hair, i.e. the white parts,  s that is hainting but still way handsome.</p>
          <p>He is only slightly bigger than the Lon Chaney pin but feels a lot of heavier in hand, A quick turn on its side, and it seems to be at least a third thicker than the latter,  The back is stamped wiyth Creepy Co. and features two diagonal pins and rubber stoppers.</p>
          <p>I bought two additional enamel pins from the company, and am super-impressed by the quality and aesthetic of all, even this simple cutie (link-teeth).</p>
          <p>This measures ____. It is a limited edition pin. There is a a human-colored version of this. And, there had been a Phibes-inspired pink one as well as (this hurts that i missed this one) a Masque of the Red Death red version - badly sunburnt.</p>

          <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h3> by Haasbroek for Tee Fury</h3>
          <p>Proof that my pop culture dalliances are not just with the horrific and dead. I bought this, along with another pin, last winter. I had spied the shirt version, which has the added "Is it me you're looking for" tagline, on a few sites ages before and felt a weak longing for it. (But, I loathe wearing white shirts.)</p>
          <p>It's small - a mere ___ inches. Light, and only has one centrally located pin on the back with a rubber stamper. The back also has a series number.</p>
          <p>TeeFury had a number of pins, and seem to be replenishing those that were bought out, like that Mr. T meets He-Man. While they did appear on a limited edition part of their site, I didn't think that they were going to do away with all of them. Hopefully, it's temporary, as they manufacture a new group. I Snake NY? One can hope.</p>

        <h1>Phantom of the Paradise</h1>
        <h3>by Pop-ocalypse from Zazzle</h3>
          <p>I buy a lot of stationary and office-type goods on Zazzle. I will randomly search for favorite film, and not find too many items that I have an interest in - until this pretty little pin-back button.</p>
          <p>As always, I underestimated the size, I should have gone with __ or ___ to get the full effect of that famous still. The black and purple background get lost - especially under my crappy inddor lighting.</p>
          <p>What's there to say? It's inoccuously attractive, lightweight, and properly manufactured. Plus, the thinness of the pin enables someone, who cares about their clothes not having holes, the ability to wear them with tighter knits. I wish it would have been offered as other products on the site.</p>

        <h1>The Morning After</h1>
        <h3>by Paul Southworth for Threadless</h3>
          <p>measures about an inch high, and 1" 1/8 at its widest. the outside line is the darkestm thickest line - highest line. the enamel is more shallow/low - not filled as much (Limited to 100)</p>
          <p>I bought the Morning After pin for young family relative, Although not quite Emo or Goth, a vomiting, Bozo-like clown amusing enough without the usual, tasteless JWG reference.</p>
          <p>At least he isn't Cepillin, a darling to children in the 70s and 80s - he's pretty creepy looking now.</p>
          <p>The pin matches PS's illustrated version on Threadless. It, however, seems a little small. Granted, I knew the measurements before buying it, but, in hand, it seemed like one of many old school pins that you'd find on a musty, tobacco-laden beret. Perhaps, it's the element of surprise - a flash of color that on closer examination reveals something comical or vile, depending on who you are. For all obnoxious purposes, I still think it should have been about 2" high.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, I have no complaints. It looks like the illustration, defect-free, and has one small ___ in the back.</p>
          <p>My general problem with a lot of pins is that the needles i the back are find for thicker materials, like canvas or wool. But, they're far too big and damaging for a light knit or shirt.</p>
